"""Whether client-supplied identity headers may be believed.

``X-Tenant-Id`` (and its companions ``X-User-Id`` / ``X-User-Roles``) are
*claims*, not credentials. Nothing in this library can verify them. Whether they
are trustworthy is a property of the **network path**, not of the request:

* Arriving through the mesh edge, they are trustworthy. The EnvoyFilter
  ``ext-authz-enforce.yaml`` strips every client-supplied tenant header and
  re-injects the value ``license-authz`` resolved from the license token, so by
  the time the header reaches the pod it is an assertion by an authority.
* Arriving pod-to-pod, they are **not** trustworthy. In-cluster callers do not
  traverse the edge EnvoyFilter, so any workload that can open a socket to the
  port can send ``X-Tenant-Id: <victim-tenant>`` and be served that tenant's
  data. The header is accepted *above* license introspection in the precedence
  chain, so a forged header wins over having no license at all.

``TRUSTED_CIDRS`` does not address this. That knob governs the *no-header* case
(:mod:`._trusted_networks`); emptying it does nothing to a request that carries
a forged header, because such a request never reaches the network check.

The knob
--------
``TRUST_TENANT_HEADER`` decides whether this process believes those headers.

**The default is ``true`` — i.e. today's behaviour, which is the insecure one.**
That is deliberate. This library is consumed by nine ``coding-*`` services with
different exposure, and several of them legitimately depend on header trust
(the gateway forwards ``X-Tenant-Id`` to backends that run with
``ENABLE_AUTH=false`` and have no other way to learn the tenant). A default of
``false`` would turn a routine lockfile refresh into a multi-service outage.
So merging this changes nothing, and the security win lands per service, as
each one sets ``TRUST_TENANT_HEADER=false`` on its Deployment once it is known
to have a verifiable alternative (a license token, or the gateway in front).

Setting it to ``false`` does **not** downgrade the caller to
``DEFAULT_TENANT_ID``. The header is ignored as though absent and resolution
continues down the normal chain — license introspection next. A request with a
forged header and no valid license gets a 401, which is the point.
